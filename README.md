# ITI-C-project-Clinic-Management-System
## Project Overview
<p>The Clinic Management System is a C-based application developed as part of my AVR diploma at the Information Technology Institute (ITI). The system offers two modes: Admin Mode and User Mode. Admins can manage patient records and reservations, while users can view patient details and appointments.
  
I used linked lists to store and manage patient information, ensuring efficient insertion, modification, and retrieval of records.</p>
